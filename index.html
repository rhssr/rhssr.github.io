<b><strong><em><i><big><h2> When i say soon, I mean... now?.... Always! Hello and welcome to the HTML5 Guide for make a website, i see you wanted to do a website like, Google! like Facebook, like Youtube, like GitHub, but sadly you don't know how to, but here is the solution of all the problems, yes, the HTML5 Guide! So i will don't talk more and start the guide! </h2></big></i></em></strong></b>

<br>
  
<h2> The first thing we must do is put something different to a tag that is very important and it is the &#60;!DOCTYPE html>, yes! This is not a tag itself, it is an instruction to the browser that you are using over the HTML version in which it is written x document. </h2>

<br>

<h2> In case the curiosity comes to your house: In the version of HTML 4.01 the browser instruction &#60;!DOCTYPE html> refers to a DTD, because its version was based on SGML. </h2>

<br>

<h2> The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers represent the content correctly. </h2>

<br>

<h2> By the way: SGML is the standardized generalized markup language or SGML, it is a standard for defining generalized markup languages for documents, ISO 8879 defines Annex A.1 for generalized markup. </h2>

<br>

<h2> The abbreviation SGML in English is Standard Generalized Markup Language. </h2>

<br>

<h2> The instruction for the browser so said here is the first thing that should be added to an HTML document for as we said before, define the HTML version, and after the instruction for the browser we must now put a tag that is the So familiar start of our document, eye: it is the beginning of the document not of the content of this. </h2>

<br>

<h2> The tag is extremely easy and for the whole family, it is <code> &#60;html> </code> </h2>

<br>

<h2> There are attributes that can be added in which tag, such as the language of the document, I usually use "in", now let's do a test: </h2>

<br>

<code>
&#60;!DOCTYPE html>

&#60;html lang="en">
</code>

<br>

<h2> With whose attribute we will define in the language of the document, eye: it is the language in the sense of the country, not the programming language or character language. </h2>

<br>

<h2> We return to the doubts, a true HTML document is not like that, more tags are missing! and from this doubt we can leave easily, there is a tag called <code> &#60;head></code> this as its name says it is the head of the document, and again: the tag &#60;head> is not where the content goes of the document. </h2>

<br>

<h2> Within this tag we can put another tag that is </h2><code> &#60;title>&#60;/title> </code>

<br>

<h2> What the &#60;title> tag does is put a title to the document apart from the name that you put, for example I call my document html: "example2.html" but I want the title to be: "Good morning!" Well look that with that tag you can do it, and for the whole family x2. </h2>

<br>

<h2> Now an example: </h2>

<code>
&#60;!DOCTYPE html>

&#60;html lang="en">
</code>

<code>
&#60;head>

&#60;title> Good Morning! &#60;/title>
</code>

<br>

<h2> Now we must close the &#60;head> tag, but we are in another big doubt, how do we close it? Very easy my dear friend, and this goes for the whole family x3 (Ok, better I stop being so heavy with that), better we change the word, this goes for the whole document, if we want to close a tag we must "make" another tag that is <head> but this will be the one that will close it, because it is different (Wow, what a poet I am!); </h2>

<br>

Example: </h2>

<code>
&#60;!DOCTYPE html>

&#60;html>
</code>

<code>
&#60;head>

&#60;title> Good Morning! &#60;/title>
</code>

<code>
&#60;/head>
</code>


<h2> Very good! Now we should put the content of our HTML document, but we fall back into a doubt, and it is: "Which tag do we need exactly to start making the content of the document?" </h2>

<br>

<h2> The answer is very simple, what do we have under our heads? The true neck? and under the neck? The body, because the tag we need is exactly the body, if the tag is <code> &#60;body></code> </h2>

<br>

<h2> With whose tag we will start to make the content, eye: content, of our HTML document. </h2>

<br>

<h2> We have discovered how to start the content of the document, but ... here comes another doubt: "How do we add a large text?" The answer is, with the tag so used by web pages, if accurate, as some may think, the tag </h2> <code> &#60;h1></code>

<br>

<h2> The h is short for: "header" and the number is "one" obviously not? Why the numbers? </h2>

<br>

<h2> The answer is simple, imagine that there are different types of "header" no? for example: number one is bigger, and number two reduces the size of the first one, what about that example? Is it true that it was good? there are 6 types of header and 6 is sadly the smallest of all :( </h2>

<br>

<h2> &#60;h6>: "Please do not bully me! I am small, it is true but I have the right to be used creators of web pages :(" </h2>

<br>

<h2> I honestly do not use it because of how small it is but good, then another day we will see how to put it bigger ;). </h2>

<br>

<h2> Now, let's make the complete example: </h2>

<code>
&#60;!DOCTYPE html>

&#60;html lang="en">
</code>

<code>
&#60;head>

&#60;title> Good Morning! &#60;/title>
</code>

<code>
&#60;/head>

&#60;body>
</code>

<code>
&#60;h1> Hello World! This is a example from the HTML5 Guide! (PS: Do not use the & # 60; h6>, HAHAHAHAAA!) &#60;/h1>
</code>

<h2> After all this we must close the tag &#60;body> as I said the tags should be closed with a slash (/) so that is what we are going to do, </h2>

<h2> And the same with the tag</h2> &#60;html>

<h2> That would leave the document at the end:</h2>

<code>
 &#60;/body>

&#60;/html>
</code>

<h2> And voila, our HTML5 document has finished, the instruction for the browser will not close.</h2>

<h2>By the way and before finishing: The HTML abbreviation means: "Hyper(-)Text Markup Language" and there are more extensions but we will see later, by the way, did you know that the HTML comes from the XML? And that the XML abbreviation means: "eXtensible Markup Language"? And that there is an extension of the HTML that is: "XHTML" and the abbreviation means: "eXtensible Hyper(-)Text Markip Language"? All this we will see later :)</h2>

<br>

<h2> Now if I say goodbye, see you tomorrow with another example, guide and tutorial, goodbye! - Cheers, rhssr.</h2>
